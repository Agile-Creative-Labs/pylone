### **1. Connection Status Indicator**  
- Display a visual indicator (e.g., a small green/red dot) to show whether the WebSocket is connected or disconnected.  
- This helps users know when they might be experiencing network issues.  

### **2. Message Timestamps**  
- Add timestamps to user and bot messages to provide context on when messages were sent/received.  
- Example: `10:45 AM - User: Hello!`  

### **3. Local Message Storage (Session Storage)**  
- Store messages in `sessionStorage` so they persist during a page refresh.  
- This improves the user experience when navigating away and back.  

### **4. Typing Indicator for User**  
- Add a "typing..." indicator when the user is actively typing to give a better UX feel.  
- Optionally, disable the send button until the user has entered text.  

### **5. Command Shortcuts**  
- Implement text-based commands like:  
  - `/clear` â†’ Clears chat history  
  - `/help` â†’ Displays available commands  

### **6. Markdown Support for Rich Formatting**  
- Support basic Markdown (bold, italics, links) in bot responses for improved readability.  

### **7. Sound Notifications for Messages**  
- Play a subtle notification sound when a new bot response is received.  
- Useful when users are multitasking.  

### **8. Connection Logs (For Debugging)**  
- Keep an internal log of WebSocket connection attempts, failures, and messages sent/received.  
- Helps debug connection issues when `debug: true` is enabled.  

### **9. Adaptive UI for Mobile & Desktop**  
- Improve chat styling to look great on both mobile and desktop, with responsive design.  
- Optionally, support swipe gestures for clearing the chat on mobile.  

Do any of these features interest you? I can implement them in your class. ðŸš€
